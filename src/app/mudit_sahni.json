I significantly contributed to launching a multi-tenant platform that introduced a new, flourishing revenue stream (currently generating a revenue of > $10 million per year) by offering white-labeled web products.</p><br><p>At <b>Gartner</b>, I led the modernization of legacy products to contemporary web platforms which led to a threefold increase in revenue across those products and improved membership retention across research domains. I've driven process improvement and automation at both organizations and contributed to saving hundreds of developer hours weekly, leading to substantial cost savings.</p><br><p>I have a love for science, particularly physics and computer science, and it drives me to constantly expand my knowledge and skill set. And then, applying what I've learned to tackle complex and intriguing challenges is a reward in itself.</p>",
